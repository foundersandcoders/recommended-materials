# Recommended materials

A collection of recommended study materials for people thinking of applying for the programme.

[A Guide to setting up your developer environment](https://github.com/dwyl/dev-setup) by our good friends at dwyl is an excellent starting point for new developers.

[Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) is a great place to start on your journey to becoming a web developer.

[Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript) is fantastic for honing your JavaScript skills.

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) has several good courses, including [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) and [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) is an excellent resource for complete beginners. We love their introduction to Computer Science as well as their JavaScript-based programming course.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is another good resource for complete beginners. We recommend [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) and the [YouTube API](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube).

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a great self-contained introduction to Javascript. The first 4 chapters are relatively easy to follow. Subsequent chapters cover more advanced topics.

[Internet History, Technology, and Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-history) on Coursera provides a nice bit of historical context.

[Javascript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) is written by the godfather of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but later chapters can be hard to follow.

[Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB), particularly Parts 2 and 3. A wonderful series of lectures by Crockford. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.

[JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts - The First 3.5 Hours](https://youtu.be/Bv_5Zv5c-Ts). The full course is on Udemy, but the first bit is free on YouTube and well worth watching.

[CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) is a fun way to reinforce CSS selectors.

[Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free). It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. 

Finally, sign up to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, but it is really worth the effort of trying to ask (or even answer!) some questions yourself.

**Reading**  
[Paul Ford - What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It's long, but quite light to read.

[Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX) shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company's philosophy.

**Watching**  
[Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.

[Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Alan Kay.

Anything with Douglas Crockford in!
